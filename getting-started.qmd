# Getting Started

This guide will explain how to get started with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) for Python and the `quarto-holoviz` extension.

## Installing Quarto

You can install everything you need with Conda

```bash
conda create -n quarto-holoviz -c conda-forge python=3.11 r-quarto perl jupyter panel hvplot matplotlib
```

This will

- Create a Python environment named `quarto-holoviz`.
- Install Quarto.
- Install `jupyter`, `panel` and other Python packages

For alternative installation methods checkout the [Quarto Getting Started Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

## Installing the `quarto-holoviz` extension

You can install the `quarto-holoviz` extension in your Quarto project via

```bash
quarto add awesome-panel/quarto-holoviz
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory. If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.

Now put this in the header of your document, or in the `_quarto.yml` file:

```yaml
filters:
  - holoviz/quarto
```

Now you may use the `{panel-convert-python}` filter as explained in the [How to use Panel Convert](example-panel-convert-python.qmd) section.
