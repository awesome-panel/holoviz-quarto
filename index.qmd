# Introduction

The purpose of this project is to **make it easy to use the [HoloViz](https://holoviz.org/) ecosystem with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)**.

We do this by providing the `quarto-holoviz` extension as well as the *how-to* guides listed in the sidebar.

The [HoloViz blog](https://blog.holoviz.org/) is currently created with the help of [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Check out the source code [here](https://github.com/holoviz-dev/blog).
